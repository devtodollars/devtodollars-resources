# My Journey From Learning Flutter to getting valued at $50K 
- i wanted to build a note-taking app that was a quick capture platform for Obsidian.
- i was originally a react developer so react native
	- But didnt fit my use case because difficult web integration, meh performance and bad experience
	- Migrated to flutter. 
- Started learning Flutter as I built the app.
	- didn’t know what state management was but just dived straight into it. 
	- Copied a template for the UI
	- Had a giant class that i passed around the widget tree
	- Wanted offline support was super important
	- Db migration
		- Started from mongodb, to firebase, to supabase.
		- Migration was a huge pain
	- Added riverpod just so I didn’t need to pass down
	- figured out how to put flutter in a chrome extension
	- learned about how to interact with JS APIs
	- Did a UI redesign
	- Spent a lot of time figuring out WYSIWYG,
- Learning how to build a startup
	- Meanwhile i was figuring out what to do to build a startup. Consuming a shit ton of resources…
	- I was learning about startup growth, experimentation, marketing
	- Found out from talking to users that
	- I mainly focused on SEO, reddit, youtube, twitter, and email newsletter marketing.
	- Applied to YC, got an interview, but was ultimately rejected because I did not think of the TAM
- If i were to do it again
	- make it super simple, charge more, and  not even us flutter. Wouldn’t waste time on UI. Probably just integrate with text messages -> Obsidian and charge an expensive price tag for it. Quick capture is actually really difficult.
		- Platform is always better can’t compete with quick capture thru text messages bc with siri, gooogle assistant, etc. it’s the best so why try to create something
	- focus on one value prop, which was quick notes to Obsidian. Took me way too long to figure it out.
	- Also, make it more data driven as in not just blindly make features. Everything I do should have a number behind it
- what im up to now
	- honestly it was the greatest experience learning Flutter and id probably say this is the fastest way to learn about Flutter.
	- Moved on to work on another app in Flutter, broke up with my cofounder and now 
	- building a community to help developers become founders. 
	- Here’s the discord invite link
	- Also happy to answer any questions if you have any!

Hi r/FlutterDev, Im Matt and I wanted to share my journey building a Flutter app. My hope is that this journey can help you avoid the pitfalls I fell through and be a good resource for building your startup.

So the startup is called Fleeting Notes, it’s an app that solves the problem of quick capture in Obsidian. The end goal was to create the only set it and forget about its quick capture solution. Here were my initial requirements:

- capture anywhere: in browser extension, mobile, desktop, web, etc
- Offline first: Part of capturing anywhere requires you to be able to capture anywhere
- Low friction: fast loading speed, UI optimized for capture
- Privacy first: E2E encryption like Obsidian
- Obsidian Sync: synced notes with Obsidian
- Fits into user workflow: notes would go where users want them to go into after setup

Given that I had experience in React, I thought React Native would be the perfect solution. But after coming across problems with performance and migrating web, I decided to give Flutter a shot. 

Compared with RN, the Flutter setup was a breeze. I was able to quickly get up and running with a UI template. At the time, I didn’t have a clue about state management, I used MongoDB for built-in offline persistence, and I implemented my own text editor.

## what i changed

## why it helped me learn so much
- learning startups
- Leanring flutter. I learned to solve a problem. People

## startup side
