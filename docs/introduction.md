# Introduction
Welcome to DevToDollars, the world's most transparent dev agency.

This is a guide for you to get started with using our processes of running our agency. We decided to open source these detailed steps for three reasons:

1. Having our processes laid out on paper allows us to run more efficiently.
2. Being transparent about everything builds trust for our existing and future clients.
3. We believe our process can help more people get started. The world needs more talented entrepreneurs.

## Let's get started
Depending on your needs, you might want to start at different points in our documentation:

- **Interested in using the boilerplate?** Check out the [code documentation](code/getting-started.md) for detailed instructions on how to get started.
- **Curious about our process?** Learn about [our agency workflow](agency/dev-agency-workflow.md) to understand how we operate and manage projects.
