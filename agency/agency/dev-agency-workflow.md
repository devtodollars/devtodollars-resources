Below are step-by-step instructions on what to do when working with the client
## [1. Estimating Software Development Costs](estimating-software-costs.md)

## 2. Design
The way to do design is to use a component library either [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (for NextJS) or [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/) (for Flutter) to create the design. Follow these steps:
1. Go to https://dribbble.com/ to find design inspirations or go to competitors and figure out what they use OR go to https://v0.dev and get design inspiration from there through a prompt
2. Adapt UI from the competitor / v0 and craft a UI in code or within Figma. If you're creating make sure to use the design kits ([material 3](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460/material-3-design-kit) , [shadcn](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1203061493325953101))
3. Create the UI and iterate with the client and make sure they are happy with the UI. I think we should iterate on the UI in code rather than in 

## 3. Functionality
- Once the UI is finalized, we need to start developing the application and connecting the frontend code with the backend code.
- If you haven't clone the [startup-boilerplate](https://github.com/devtodollars/startup-boilerplate) template and build off of that. This will make it a lot easier to build an app and comes with a lot of the needed components.
- More information is in the docs.

## 4. Iterate
- After functionality is built out we iterate with the client and we try to keep the in the loop as long as possible as we build out everything.
