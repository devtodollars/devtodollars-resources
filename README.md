# Landing Page Resources

This repository contains the resources that is loaded into the [landing-page repository](https://github.com/devtodollars/landing-page) through this [script](https://github.com/devtodollars/landing-page/blob/main/add-remote-resources.js) on build.

To update the website resources, just make commits to the `main` branch. Then a github workflow will trigger a netlify hook to deploy a new version of the app which will pull the latest changes from the `main` branch here.
